# CLAUDE.md

Project-specific context for Claude Code sessions. Keep this updated as the project evolves.

## What this project is

A solo-developer systematic trading system for US ETFs. Daily-bar strategies (trend following, cross-sectional momentum, mean reversion) combined under HMM regime overlay + portfolio vol targeting, executed through Alpaca. Same code runs backtest / paper / live behind a broker interface.

**Authoritative docs:**
- `PRD.md` — full product spec (scope, stack, architecture, risk limits)
- `implementationplan.md` — prescriptive 20-week build plan, one wave per week
- `README.md` — onboarding for a human developer
- `CHANGELOG.md` — wave-by-wave delivery log

When in doubt, the PRD wins. If the PRD is silent, the implementation plan wins.

## Working style

Work is delivered in **waves** that map 1:1 to implementation plan weeks. After each wave:
1. Update `CHANGELOG.md` under the current wave section.
2. Update the **Status** section below.
3. Stop. The user commits + pushes.

Do not run `git commit` or `git push` unless explicitly asked.

## Status

**Current wave:** 12 — Risk layer (complete, awaiting commit)
**Next wave:** 13 — Research sprint (Gate 2 evaluation, no new code)

### Completed
- **Wave 1 (Week 1)** — project scaffold, CI, smoke test
- **Wave 2 (Week 2)** — Pydantic Settings + YAML configs, shared domain types, SQLAlchemy 2.0 ORM, async psycopg3 pool, repos, Alembic initial migration (verified end-to-end against Dockerized Postgres + TimescaleDB)
- **Wave 3 (Week 3)** — YFinance + Alpaca loaders, Parquet cache, validation pipeline, `scripts/backfill.py` CLI (cache-hit path measured at 0.8s, vs 4.9s network fetch)
- **Wave 4 (Week 4)** — technical / cross-sectional / regime feature libraries, look-ahead-bias property test across 13 entry points, benchmark at 0.6s (budget 10s) for 10 ETFs × 20 years
- **Wave 5 (Week 5)** — Faber-style `TrendSignal`, daily-bar backtest engine + tearsheet, `scripts/run_backtest.py` CLI. Acceptance on SPY/EFA/IEF + SHY 2003-2026: Sharpe 0.72 vs 1/3 buy-and-hold 0.71, max DD cut -38.5% → -16.9% — canonical Faber profile. 137/137 tests green.
- **Wave 6 (Week 6)** — walk-forward + Deflated Sharpe harness (`walk_forward`, Bailey/LdP DSR, JSONL trial log, `scripts/validate_strategy.py`). Gate 1 cleared: trend OOS Sharpe +0.60 ≥ 0.4, DSR probability 0.744, deflated excess +0.19; adversarial 3-param sweep (18 trials) correctly rejected (exit 1, deflated excess -0.05). 174/174 tests green.
- **Wave 7 (Week 7)** — `Broker` ABC with `PaperBroker` (deterministic simulator) and `AlpacaBroker` (alpaca-py wrapper) behind a shared surface; `OrderManager` drives submit/retry/poll with tenacity. 100% coverage on `src/quant/execution/`. Live Alpaca paper round-trip test gated on creds. 226/226 tests green.
- **Wave 8 (Week 8)** — `LiveRunner.run_daily_cycle()` walks PRD §4.2 end-to-end (signal → delta orders → submit → reconcile → persist), with `CycleScheduler` (APScheduler) and `DiscordNotifier`. Dry-run CLI runs in 1.7s (budget 10s). 3-day paper cycle against Postgres shows coherent state (no dup orders, no ghost positions, broker↔DB parity). 237/237 tests green.
- **Wave 9 (Week 9)** — paper-deployment infra: `python -m quant.live.scheduler --broker alpaca-paper --persist` is the 5-day daemon; `make paper-run` / `make paper-dry` / `make review` wrap it. `scripts/review.py` prints equity curve + positions + orders + signals from Postgres. 5-day simulated cycle test proves zero errors and drift convergence. `docs/journal.md` is the per-day log. 239/239 tests green. **Operational handoff:** user runs `make paper-run` for 5 trading days and fills in `docs/journal.md` before Wave 10.
- **Wave 10 (Week 10)** — `MomentumSignal` (6mo rank, top-3, monthly rebalance) + `portfolio.combine_weights`. Momentum passes Wave 6 validation (OOS Sharpe +0.77, DSR PSR 0.85, deflated excess +0.34). Combined trend+momentum (4/7, 3/7) Sharpe 0.730 > both alone but 1.094x best-single misses the 1.10 target by 0.6pp; correlation 0.66 misses the <0.5 target. Both shortfalls flagged for Week 13 research sprint — the mechanism is tested and correct; the structural decorrelation is what regime overlay (W15) + vol targeting (W16) address. 262/262 tests green.
- **Wave 11 (Week 11)** — `MeanReversionSignal` (IBS + RSI-2 entry, IBS exit; daily cadence; state-change emissions only). Passes WF+DSR at Alpaca costs: OOS Sharpe +0.60, DSR PSR 0.74. All-period corr vs trend **0.27** (stress 0.20, calm 0.45). **3-strategy combined Sharpe 0.828, maxDD -13.60% — 1.185x best-single, clears the 1.10 target previously missed by trend+momentum alone.** Literal "negative correlation during calm periods" unmet (long-only → both long-biased); flagged as PRD-impossible without shorts. 280/280 tests green.
- **Wave 12 (Week 12)** — `RiskValidator` (PRD §6.1 hard limits: order size, position size, price deviation) + `DrawdownTracker` (daily loss + rolling monthly DD) + `Killswitch` (file sentinel). Pre-trade hooks wired into `OrderManager`; kill-switch engaged → `LiveRunner._flatten_cycle` flattens within one cycle. **100% coverage on `src/quant/risk/` + `src/quant/execution/`**. Hypothesis property test (10,000 random orders) confirms no false accepts/rejects. 343/343 tests green. Gate 2 code-side prep complete.

### In progress
- _none_

### Gate 1 — CLEARED
**End of Week 6:** trend strategy passes Deflated Sharpe > 0 (deflated excess +0.19) and walk-forward OOS Sharpe ≥ 0.4 (+0.60 concatenated across 6 rolling folds). Adversarial overfit variant is rejected by the DSR harness with exit 1.

### Gates ahead
- **Gate 1 (end of Week 6):** trend strategy must pass Deflated Sharpe > 0, walk-forward OOS Sharpe ≥ 0.4
- **Gate 2 (end of Week 13):** ≥2 of 3 strategies survive full validation
- **Gate 3 (end of Week 19):** 30-day paper Sharpe within 50% of backtest Sharpe
- **Gate 4 (Week 20 + 1 week live):** autonomous run with no critical alerts

|---|---|---|
| `src/quant/risk/` | 100% | mypy `--strict` |
| `src/quant/execution/` | 100% | mypy `--strict` |
| `src/quant/portfolio/sizing.py` | 100% | mypy `--strict` |
| `src/quant/signals/` | >80% | mypy default |
| `src/quant/features/` | >80% | mypy default |
| `src/quant/backtest/` | best effort | mypy default |

Property tests (hypothesis) are mandatory for `risk/`: 10,000 random orders, no valid order rejected, no invalid order accepted.

## Conventions

- Conventional commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`, `test:`, `docs:`, `chore:`).
- Feature branches, PR + self-review even solo. `main` is always deployable.
- No direct commits to `main`.
- Every wave ends with a passing CI build.
- Config drift (live config hash != last-deployed hash) → refuse to start.

## Risk invariants (never violate)

- `src/quant/risk/` limits cannot be disabled by config — they are code-enforced.
- Killswitch file `/var/run/quant/HALT` is checked every tick. If present → flatten all, halt.
- Hard limits (PRD §6.1):
  - Max single position 30% equity
  - Max daily loss -5% → flatten + halt 24h
  - Max monthly DD -15% → flatten + manual restart
  - Order size >20% equity → reject unless override
  - Price deviation >1% from last quote → reject
- Never commit secrets. `.env` is gitignored; `.env.example` lists required vars.
